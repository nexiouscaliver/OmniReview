"""OmniCheck verification model v2 — deterministic classification + gate.

Single semantic home for "how a finding is verified" (P1). The push sweep
(omni_sweep.py, P2) and the check-mode skill both consume this module's
vocabulary VERBATIM; the vocabulary decision itself lives in
../references/verdict-model.md.

Layers:
  is_artifact()        — artifact/command filtering (never findings)
  extract_severity()   — critical|important|minor from posted-body markers
  extract_kind()       — code|test|docs|process|decision
  extract_consent()    — valid consent (deferred / declined / decision) from
                         human replies; bot boilerplate never counts
  classify_thread()    — one structured finding record per thread
  classify_run()       — full run: findings + artifacts, gate-ready
  gate()               — CLEAN | READY_WITH_NOTES | BLOCKED rule table

Everything here is pure and stdlib-only: no network, no LLM, no repo access.
The verification RESULT (was an open thread's fix present in the diff?) is an
INPUT (`verification`), produced by check-mode analysis or the sweep — this
module never guesses it.
